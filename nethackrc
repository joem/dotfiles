# Can also be defined by using ASCII values instead of characters; see Custom map symbols#DUNGEON.
# The order of the symbols is: solid rock, vertical wall, horizontal wall, upper left corner, upper right corner, lower left corner, lower right corner, cross wall, upward T wall, downward T wall, leftward T wall, rightward T wall, no door, vertical open door, horizontal open door, vertical closed door, horizontal closed door, iron bars, tree, floor of a room, dark corridor, lit corridor, stairs up, stairs down, ladder up, ladder down, altar, grave, throne, kitchen sink, fountain, pool or moat, ice, lava, vertical lowered drawbridge, horizontal lowered drawbridge, vertical raised drawbridge, horizontal raised drawbridge, air, cloud, under water.

# 
# menu_headings
# Controls how the headings in a menu are highlighted. Compound option, with possible values of bold, inverse, or underline. Not all ports can actually display all three types.
# 
# menustyle
# Controls the interface used when you need to choose various objects (in response to the Drop command, for instance). Compound option, with following possible values:
# traditional - prompt for object class characters, followed by an object-by-object prompt for all matching items
# combination - prompt for object classes of interest, then display a menu of matching objects

# full - display a menu of object classes, and then a menu of matching objects
# 
# name
# The name of your character. Compound option, defaults to your user name. If set to player, then NetHack will ask for the user name, even on systems where it normally wouldn't. If suffixed with dash and character role letter, then also defines the character role, or if suffixed with -@, then selects a random role. Cannot be set in-game.
# Can also be used as its own option-line:
# NAME=player
# 
# number_pad
# Use the number keys to move instead of [yuhjklbn].
# 0=use [yuhjklbn] (default)
# 1=use [79428613]
# 2=use [79428613] and invokes the old DOS behavior where `5' means `g', meta-`5' means `G', and meta-`0' means `I'
# With number_pad:1 or number_pad:2, counts need to be prefixed with 'n' (n50s to search 50 times). Also, some extended commands are available in a short form (l=#loot, u=#untrap, etc).
# For backwards compatibility, number_pad without a value is synonymous to number_pad:1.
